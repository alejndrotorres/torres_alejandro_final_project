# Fall2023_final_project

Simple overview of use/purpose.
So the user of this game that I make can have fun playing a game of snake.
## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.
I am going to create a screen game that replicates the game of snake. The user will be able to choose what color snake they will want to be. Then they will be able to customize what kind of food they would like to eat as the snake. Then they will choose what gamemode they want to play in. They will have a limited space on the screen that they will be able to move with. Screen is looked at like from a birds eye view. When the snake eats a piece of the fruit/vegeable selected by the player, then the snakes body will grow in length. If the snake touches another part of their body or hits the border, then they will die. Highest score will be tracked. Goal is to fill the screen without dying.
